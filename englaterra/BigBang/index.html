            HISTORY
        </div>
        <div class="historiatexto">
            ㅤThe history of Big Ben dates back to the 19th century, during the Victorian era in England. The clock tower was designed as part of the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster, which had been severely damaged by fire in 1834.

    The architect chosen for the project was Charles Barry, while construction was led by Augustus Pugin. Construction on the clock tower began in 1843 and was completed in 1859. The tower was designed in the Victorian Gothic style, with ornate details and an impressive height of 96 meters.
<br>
ㅤThe tower's official name is Elizabeth Tower, in honor of Queen Elizabeth II, who ascended the throne in 1952. However, the name "Big Ben" is popularly used to refer to both the tower and the clock's bell.

Big Ben's bell, known as the Great Bell, was cast in 1858 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. It weighs around 13.5 tons and has since become one of the most famous bells in the world.

The Big Ben clock was designed by Edmund Beckett Denison and operated by the watch company Dent. It is a mechanical clock with four faces, each with a diameter of 7 meters. The mechanism is powered by weights and strings, and the watch's accuracy is widely admired.
<br>
ㅤOver the years, Big Ben has become one of London's most recognizable and beloved landmarks. It is a popular tourist attraction, with millions of visitors admiring its imposing architecture and hearing the bell ring on special occasions.

In August 2017, restoration work began on the Big Ben tower, including the decommissioning of the bell to protect workers. Since then, the bell rings only on special occasions, such as the New Year and commemorative events.

Despite being both a tower and a bell, Big Ben has become an iconic symbol of London and a culturally significant landmark not only for Londoners, but for people all over the world.
