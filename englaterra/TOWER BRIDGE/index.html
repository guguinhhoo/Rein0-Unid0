        <div class="historiatexto">
            ㅤ Construction on Tower Bridge began in 1886 and was completed in 1894. It was designed by Horace Jones and Sir John Wolfe Barry, in response to the need for a new bridge across the River Thames to allow ships to pass.

            Tower Bridge is built in a Victorian Gothic style with two impressive towers and a suspension bridge in the middle. Its most striking feature is the central sections that can be lifted to allow the passage of large vessels.
            <br>
            ㅤ  During its construction, more than 400 workers were involved in the project. The structure was assembled on site and, once complete, became an engineering marvel of its time.
            
            Tower Bridge was officially opened on June 30, 1894 by Queen Victoria. On that occasion, a procession of ships passed under the raised bridge, demonstrating its functionality.
            <br>
            Over the years, Tower Bridge has undergone numerous restorations and renovations to preserve its structure and functionality. Today, it remains an important shipping route on the River Thames and an iconic symbol of London.
